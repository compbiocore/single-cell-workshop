## Goals

This workshop, '10X Chromium Single-Cell RNA-seq Workshop', is designed to introduce attendees to single-cell data analysis with the R programming language; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  It will introduce attendees to the tools associated with 10x-based single-cell analysis, including those provided by 10x Genomics and those implemented in R/Bioconductor.  The general principles of single-cell RNA-seq will also be covered.

## Workshop Topic Overview

* Introduction to 10x Genomics Single-Cell Tools

* Applications Utilizing Single-Cell Technology from 10x Genomics

* 10x Genomics Data Analysis Software Suite Review

* Overview of Data Analysis for Single-Cell RNA-seq

* A Generic Introduction to Single-Cell RNA-seq Analyses and Interpretations
