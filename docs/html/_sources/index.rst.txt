Purpose
=======

This site hosts the Jupyter notebooks for the CBC Single-Cell Analysis Workshop.  The notebooks will be served on the web as static HTML pages, meaning that while they looks like live notebooks, they cannot be edited - to access these notebooks, please click the link in the sidebar.  To obtain an editable copy of the notebook files, please click the respective 'Download Notebook' link below.  These 3 notebooks were created by Ashok Ragavendran.
