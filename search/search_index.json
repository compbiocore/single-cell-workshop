It will introduce attendees to the tools associated with 10x-based single-cell analysis, including those provided by 10x Genomics and those implemented in R/Bioconductor. The general principles of single-cell RNA-seq will also be covered. Workshop Topic Overview Introduction to 10x Genomics Single-Cell Tools Applications Utilizing Single-Cell Technology from 10x Genomics 10x Genomics Data Analysis Software Suite Review Overview of Data Analysis for Single-Cell RNA-seq A Generic Introduction to Single-Cell RNA-seq Analyses and Interpretations Notebook To access a read-only version of the workshop notebooks (complete with full output), please click the above link; you will be redirected to Jupyter's NBViewer utility.
